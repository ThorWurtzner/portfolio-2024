                My magnum opus. A project that has grown to wild proportions, and undoubtedly the one I am most proud of. 
                It runs through a proxy to circumvent CORS, breaks several of the academy's rules - and has essentially become the ugliest codebase I have ever seen. 
                But it is mine, created without helpâ€”since no help can be found for the monster of an application that Dracanvas (Dracula theme, Canvas - get it?) has become.

                    Each line of code is a testament to my journey through growing as a Software Developer. The countless hours spent debugging in the dead of night, 
                    and the thrill of overcoming one impossible hurdle after another. <br/>
                    Despite its convoluted structure and labyrinthine logic, it stands as a beacon of personal achievement.
